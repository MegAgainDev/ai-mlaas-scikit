# [Diabetes Risk Assessment](https://github.com/MegAgainDev/mlaas/riskassesment/db/)

## Description
In this demonstration, I will train a model starting from a CSV datasource.  This model will predict wellness base on your age and specific health conditions.

### Home Page
From the [Diabetes Risk Assessment home page](https://MegAgaindev.pythonanywhere.com/), this web app pulls diabetic data and images from an external health and wellness API website: [News API](http://Newsapi.org)

### Risk Prediction Questionnaire
The data will be capture by completing the [Diabetes Risk Prediction Questions](https://megagaindev.pythonanywhere.com/questions).  The results will display with recommendations and next steps.
